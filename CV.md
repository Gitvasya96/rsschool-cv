### Briefly About Myself:
I'm 26 yers old. My current location is  Gomiel, Belarus. This is the city I was born in. I've finished a middle school, a technical colledge, and army. Right now I'm a chief bartender in one of the most popular places in the city. In 2022 I've started RS-school courses to join the community of IT-sphere. I think I have all the required skills to make it to the end of the courses and become a successfull frontend developer. My goal is to deliver quality products to the people and make their lives easier in all spheres. Because that is what what developer do.
